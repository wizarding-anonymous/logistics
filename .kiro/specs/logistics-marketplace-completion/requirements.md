# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the completion and enhancement of the existing B2B/B2C logistics marketplace platform. The platform connects shippers (clients) with logistics providers (suppliers) across various transportation modes including road, rail, air, sea, courier services, warehousing, fulfillment, and customs brokerage. The system supports both domestic Russian and international EAEU shipments with potential for English localization.

The current implementation includes basic microservices architecture with FastAPI backends, React frontend, and Flutter mobile app. This specification focuses on completing missing functionality, ensuring all business requirements are met, and implementing proper security, monitoring, and operational features.
